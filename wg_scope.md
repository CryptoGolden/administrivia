This document will function as general guidelines for moving Immersive Web features from ideas through incubation and into a standard.



*   Most features will begin their life as a proposal in the IW Community Group - as per the [Community Group's guidelines for proposals](https://github.com/immersive-web/proposals/blob/master/README.md), new ideas should be filed as an issue on [https://github.com/immersive-web/proposals](https://github.com/immersive-web/proposals), and most design work will occur in a repository created for that proposal.  That repo will continue to incubate in the Community Group until it's gathered enough support to move to a Recommendation-track specification in a Working Group.
*   Moving to the WG requires a set of criteria to be met:
    *   There should be significant agreement from implementers that the proposal is baked enough to move to the Working Group to lock down and ship.  Having at least two implementers who have built prototypes is a significant signal. Tests should be developed at this stage. 
    *   For each significant feature, the WG chairs will conduct a straw poll of WG members on whether to adopt the proposal into the WG.
    *   The feature needs to be covered by the scope of the WG's current charter.  For many features this will not be a problem, as the scope intentionally gives some measure of flexibility.  However, if a feature is clearly not within the current scope, work with the chairs - we will have to take it on in our next rechartering.
