# Anchors and Hit-testing
At our September '18 F2F, we spent a good chunk of time digging into the techncial constraints of frames of references, coordinate systems, and the behaviors of the various XR platforms that WebXR will be built on top of.  This laid a very solid foundation for subsequently putting together a concrete design that addressed all the relevant constraints.  At TPAC this year, we're going to attempt the same approach to understanding [hit-testing](https://github.com/immersive-web/hit-test) and [anchors](https://github.com/immersive-web/anchors).

* Platform owners will be asked to describe:
  * Is hit-testing supported and how does it behave?
  * What does "anchors" mean in their platform?
  * Are "markers" or other "trackable" items supported?  In what way?
  * Is "plane identification" supported? How does it behave?
* Attempt to group the underlying platform features into WebXR features and establish placeholder terminology (without devolving into bikeshedding)
* Discuss how to move anchors and hit-testing features forward across incubation and the WebXR Device API.
