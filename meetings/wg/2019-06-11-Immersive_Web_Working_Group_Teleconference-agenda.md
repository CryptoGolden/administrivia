* The purpose of this call is to discuss a proposal the Chairs and Editors are pulling together for the modularisation of the WebXR Device API, for us to respond to questions and gather your feedback on contentious points.  We will be sending out this proposal on Monday, prior to the call.  The following week's call (June 18th) will also be used for addressing modularisation and responding to feedback.
