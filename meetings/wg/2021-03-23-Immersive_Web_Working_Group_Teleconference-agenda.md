As far as I know the current status is that there's a prototype implementation in Chrome behind the "WebXR incubations" flag along with the draft [explainer](https://github.com/immersive-web/marker-tracking/blob/main/explainer.md). There was interest from Microsoft (@thetuvix if I remember correctly) to consider expanding it to include QR code support.
