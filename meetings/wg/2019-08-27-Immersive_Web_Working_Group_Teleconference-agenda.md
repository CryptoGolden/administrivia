*  REMINDER: After the modularisation you may miss important updates to features you care about please follow [WebXR Gamepads Module](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr-gamepads-module/) & [WebXR AR Module](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr-ar-module/) on Github.
* [Figure out what the additive blend mode should do with alpha values](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr-ar-module/issues/14) - https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr-ar-module/#dom-xrenvironmentblendmode-additive
* [Should XRWebGLLayers clear/invalidate their framebuffers prior to each frame](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr/issues/775) - I'm relatively certain that we've had this conversation before and that the consensus was "yes, they should" but I can't find any record of it (which is a fail on my part) so let's get this done properly!
* [Spatial tracking on inline sessions when viewed within an XR headset](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr/issues/756) - NellWaliczek - First up, I'm not suggesting the core spec include a diorama reference space.  I filed that in proposals a while back, which is absolutely the right place to track it.  (See https://github.com/immersive-web/proposals/issues/31) 
* [Behavior of window.requestAnimationFrame and window.requestIdleCallback when presenting](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr/issues/225) - toji - Short and sweet: When we're in WebVR presentation mode on devices without an external display, should the page continue pumping the window rAF and rIC loops?
