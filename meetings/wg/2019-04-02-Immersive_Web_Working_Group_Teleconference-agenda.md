* [Update spec and explainer to clarify pose and transform semantics](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr/pull/569) - Klaus  - This is intended to address issues #477, #565, and #567 which all involve areas where the spec isn't entirely clear about intended behavior.
* [Format of Gamepad identifiers](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr/issues/550) - toji - I wanted to separate this discussion out from the rest of the gamepad-as-the-input-solution work, because it's a reasonably complex topic on it's own.
* [Consider removing utility functions / properties from the spec](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr/issues/507) - Currently, the spec contains few properties that could be considered "utility / helper" - they don't make the specification more capable, but only reduce the amount of code that app developer needs to write. Depending on our philosophy of what the spec should contain (ex. expose smallest API surface that is needed to enable content creators), we might want to remove such methods and pay attention to not add more of them.
