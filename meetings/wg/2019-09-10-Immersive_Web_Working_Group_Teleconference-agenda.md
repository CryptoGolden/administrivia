* [TAG Feedback: Should supportsSession resolve with a boolean?](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr/issues/824) - From the [TAG feedback for the WebXR API](https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/403#issuecomment-527299905):
* [[Feature Policy] should not control exposure of navigator.xr](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr/issues/823) - https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr/#feature-policy currently says that the "policy-controlled feature... controls whether the `xr` attribute is exposed on the `Navigator` object."
* [Revisit transient input sources & XRInputSource.targetRaySpace](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr/issues/819) - Manishearth - It seems to me that the description of `XRInputSource`s currently do not cover well the cases of `XRInputSource`s that do not constantly produce positional data. The current approach to such input sources is to expose them only for the duration of their primary action (see [transient input](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr/#transient-input) section in the spec).
* [Figure out what the additive blend mode should do with alpha values](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr-ar-module/issues/14) - https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr-ar-module/#dom-xrenvironmentblendmode-additive
