* [Decide on test API to match "VR complete" and update Web Platform Tests](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr/issues/691) - Manishearth - Web Platform Tests (WPTs) are critical to increasing the likelihood of interoperability, especially with so many early implementations in the works. Tests are also an important part of showing [implementation experience](https://www.w3.org/2019/Process-20190301/#implementation-experience), which is required to move the spec through the W3C process. In order for the WPTs to be effective, we need to ensure they are written in a way that is compatible with the various implementations and that there is good coverage for the specification's algorithms.
